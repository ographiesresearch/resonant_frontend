## Netlify Deployment
https://elaborate-kitsune-f9e948.netlify.app/

This is the frot end for the Solar Low-Income Tax Credit Map, [currently deployed on Netlify](https://elaborate-kitsune-f9e948.netlify.app/). built using Svelte, SvelteKit, Node, Bulma, and Mapbox that can be easily customized using the fields in `src/config/instance.json`, as well as the layers and geomtries provided.

## Configuration

### Node
Assuming you have node installed, you can install all dependencies by running `npm install` from the root directory.

### MapBox Token
For the application to run, you'll need a MapBox token. The application expects it to be stored in a `.env` file in the root directory. E.g., this file should look like...

```
MAPBOX_TOKEN='your token here`
```

Important note: the token _will be exposed to the client_! As such, before deploying, you should make sure that your token is appropriately scoped and that it has URL restrictions in place. 

## Running
Run `npm run css-build && npm run dev` from the root folder. (On subsequent runs, you can simply run `npm run dev`. This starts a vite server (`vite dev`) and a node-sass watcher that watches for changes in `src/styles/style.scss` (the latter supports rapid Bulma development).
